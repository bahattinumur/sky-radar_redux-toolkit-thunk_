<h1>SKY RADAR _redux-toolkit-thunk_</h1>

Sky Radar is a user friendly and dynamic application that allows you to track up to 300 aircraft in real-time using data obtained from RapidAPI. The data is automatically refreshed every 10 seconds, ensuring access to current information at all times. Developed with the dynamism of React, the application enables you to quickly view detailed information by clicking on any aircraft. In addition to this dynamism, Redux Toolkit provides fast state management, ensuring that data is updated instantly. Sky Radar presents the brand, model, tail code, airline company, departure and arrival airports, as well as departure and arrival times in AM and PM formats. Furthermore, it displays the route from the aircraft's departure point to its current location as a line on the map. To clear the route displayed on the map, you can use the "Clear Route" button.
